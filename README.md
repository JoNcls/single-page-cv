  <h2>Introduction ✨</h2>
  <p>
    Hi! I'm Josua, a <em>Fullstack Developer</em> and suppose to be <em>Data Scientist</em> to (I used to learn it) <br>
    {{<strong>The CV should be valid until August 2025</strong>}}
  </p>
  <p>
    Gaming was my Hobbies, but I don't think I can make an income from that as it will ruin the experience. So here I am gamify my job and project, split it as quests and side quests, Dailies and weekly task, and setting a clear goal to determine the deadline like an time limited event.  
  </p>
  <p> 
    AI is my bestfriend (<strong>Still using Google!</strong>) on working or simply asking what I need to know, boosting my job while learning it for future encounter. Saving and take notes on new knowledge so I can revisit it later.

  <h2> About Me 🤞</h2>
  <p>I'm a fresh developer that learn by doing and working alongside with AI to boost my learning and get the job done.</p>
  <p>Enrolled in Computer Science and Specialized in Artificial Intelligence. Mosly I learn about the code fundamental but never working on a real cases so I can say I'm still lost in several part
  </p>
  <p>While I can blatantly tell that hiring me was a complete gamble but I'll promise it will be the best gamble you can take.👌</p>
  <p>I can't be separated with my games and fun, so that's why I always plan my time during the deadline given so, I can manage between work and my session. <strong>I'll prioritize work of course</strong></p>
